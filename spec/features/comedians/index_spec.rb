  # User Story 7
  #
  # As a visitor
  # When I visit `/comedians`
  # Then I see an area at the top of the page called 'Statistics'
  # In that 'Statistics' area, I see the following information:
  # - the average age of all comedians on the page (if the page is
  # filtered for specific comedians, the statistics should reflect the new group)
  # - a unique list of cities for each comedian on the page
  #
  # Averaging and uniqueness should be done in ActiveRecord NOT
  # using Ruby
